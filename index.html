            domoins as b2b lead generater and as social media optimizer. But i was not okay with ordinary lifestyle with less income<br>
            so then i was simply thinking about future and frustrated about career, after wasting of 4 years i met a friend and <br>
            suddenly everything got changed, he made me realize what am up to after seeing such potential in me.<br><br>
